# Yes, we're getting married! 🎉

Hi there,

In this page we'd like to share with you useful information you might want to know about our wedding.

Admittedly, we don't have much to announce yet, but the best is yet to come… We will share more details as we sort them out ourselves (e.g., recommendations on how to arrive to the location, where to stay, interesting things to do during your visit to Italy, etc.), be sure to check out this page from time to time.

So here's what we _do_ know so far:


## 🗓️ Save the date

We will get married on June 25th, 2021.

## 📍Location

The place is called "Antico Casale Cesenatico" and [this is their website](http://anticocasalecesenatico.com).

For whatever it's worth here's the address as it appears on the website:

> Via Cannucceto, 10
> 47042 Cesenatico FC
> Italy

Do NOT GPS-navigate to the location by looking up their address straight from the website however, otherwise you will end up in other people's home. Trust us, we've been there! It's very close to our location and they're lovely people, but we'd rather have you in our own party.

Use this link https://goo.gl/maps/HDcbyhjBNG72bNDD9 instead, which should pinpoint to the exact location.
