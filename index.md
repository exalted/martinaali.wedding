# YES! We're getting married

Hi there,

This is admittedly a very simple page where we will share with you all the useful information you might want to know about our wedding.

We are figuring out many details as we go, and as soon as we have more to share we will do so by updating this very page (e.g., recommendations on how to arrive to the location, where to stay, interesting things to do during your visit to Italy, etc.) So, be sure to check out this page from time to time‚Ä¶


## üóìÔ∏è Save the date

We will get married on **June 25th, 2021** ([click here to add the date to your calendar]({{ '/assets/calendar/martina-ali-wedding.ics?v=' | append: site.github.build_revision | relative_url }})).

## ü¶† COVID-19

The latest news is that the EU will adopt a "green pass" (aka "green certificate") starting mid-June for those who either have been vaccinated or can prove that they have been infected by the virus and they're fully recovered from it.

Meanwhile, Italy is introducing its own allowances starting mid-May, which can be summarized like so:

* If you're coming from EU member countries, UK, Israel, etc. (essentially those countries where most of the population has been vaccinated), starting Mid May, you will be able to travel to Italy, without having to quarantine.
* If you're coming from the USA, starting mid-June, you will highly likely be able to travel to Italy, without having to quarantine. (On this one we're still waiting for the EU to come up with "green pass" rules.)
* If you're coming from other countries you will be asked to self-quarantine for about 10 days when you enter Italy. (You might also have to check with your local embassies if they will issue you a visa or a travel permit.)

Regardless of where you are coming from;

* You will have to prove that you have been vaccinated (or have recovered from the virus) in the last 6 months.
* You will have to do a swab test (PCR molecular) in the last 48 hours before departure.

## üìçLocation

The location is called "Antico Casale Cesenatico" and <a href="http://anticocasalecesenatico.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is their website</a>.

**Do NOT** GPS-navigate to the location by looking up their address straight from the website however, otherwise you will end up in other people's home. Trust us, we've been there‚Ä¶ Although the address on the website would guide you to a very close location and you would met with lovely people, we'd rather have you in our own party!

Here the "official" address as it appears on their website:

```
Via Cannucceto, 10
47042 Cesenatico FC
Italy
```

Use <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/HDcbyhjBNG72bNDD9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**this link**</a> to pinpoint to the exact location using Google Maps.

> You might figure they also manage a small bed and breakfast at the same location, however we do not necessarily recommend you staying there as it is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and it's not cheap.


## üöó Travel recommendations

The closest international airport to Cesenatico is <a href="https://www.bologna-airport.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Guglielmo Marconi Airport - BLQ, Bologna</a>, however due to ongoing pandemic it might be tricky to fly there since it is a smaller airport. Your best alternatives are:

1. <a href="https://www.milanomalpensa-airport.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Malpensa Airport - MXP, Milan</a>
2. <a href="https://www.milanbergamoairport.it/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Orio al Serio International Airport - BGY, Milan</a>
3. <a href="https://www.adr.it/web/aeroporti-di-roma-en-/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fiumicino International Airport - FCO, Rome</a>

We think it's best if you could rent a car for your stay. However if you think you won't be moving too much, you will still need to call a taxi to get to the wedding location. Cesenatico taxi service's number is [+39 0547 81365](tel:+39 0547 81365). (They should understand some English, but in case you're in trouble, you can ask Ali to coordinate.)
