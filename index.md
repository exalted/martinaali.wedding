# YES! We're getting married. 🎉

Hi there,

In this admittedly very basic page we'd like to share with you all the useful information you might want to know about our wedding.

We are figuring out many details as we go, and as soon as we have something to share we will do so by updating this page (e.g., recommendations on how to arrive to the location, where to stay, interesting things to do during your visit to Italy, etc.)

Be sure to check out this page from time to time…

So, here's what we _do_ know so far:


## 🗓️ Save the date

We will get married on June 25th, 2021.


## 📮 RSVP

Please [let us know you](#-contact-us) won't miss our special day no later than June 1st, 2021.

Also, please make sure read dedicated [COVID section](#-covid) before you decide.


## ☎️ Contact us

You can call, email, WhatsApp, iMessage, etc. Ali anytime:

Email: [asd@pittle.org](mailto:asd@pittle.org)
Phone: [+39 320 8807212](tel:+39 320 8807212)


## 📍Location

The place is called "Antico Casale Cesenatico" and [this is their website](http://anticocasalecesenatico.com).

For whatever it's worth here's the address as it appears on the website:

```
Via Cannucceto, 10
47042 Cesenatico FC
Italy
```

Do NOT GPS-navigate to the location by looking up their address straight from the website however, otherwise you will end up in other people's home. Trust us, we've been there! It's very close to our location and they're lovely people, but we'd rather have you in our own party.

Use [this link](https://goo.gl/maps/HDcbyhjBNG72bNDD9) instead to pinpoint to the exact location using Google Maps.
