# YES! We're getting married. 🎉

Hi there,

This is admittedly a very basic page in which we'd like to share with you all the useful information you might want to know about our wedding.

We are figuring out many details as we go, and as soon as we have something to share we will do so by updating this page (e.g., recommendations on how to arrive to the location, where to stay, interesting things to do during your visit to Italy, etc.) So, be sure to check out this page from time to time…

Here's what we _do_ know so far:


## 🗓️ Save the date

<!-- TODO: (Maybe) Add link to iCalendar (*.ics) -->

We will get married on June 25th, 2021.


## 📮 RSVP

Please [let us know](#-contact-us) that you won't miss our special day **no later than June 1st, 2021**.

<!-- Also, please make sure read dedicated [COVID section](#-covid) before you decide. -->


## ☎️ Contact us

You can call, email, WhatsApp, iMessage, etc. Ali anytime:

* Email: [asd@pittle.org](mailto:asd@pittle.org)
* Phone: [+39 320 8807212](tel:+39 320 8807212)


## 📍Location

The location is called "Antico Casale Cesenatico" and <a href="http://anticocasalecesenatico.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is their website</a>.

**Do NOT** GPS-navigate to the location by looking up their address straight from the website however, otherwise you will end up in other people's home. Trust us, we've been there! It's very close to our location and they're lovely people, but we'd rather have you in our own party.

Make sure to read [how-to get there](#-how-to-get-there) section.

For whatever it's worth here's their address as it appears on the website:

```
Via Cannucceto, 10
47042 Cesenatico FC
Italy
```

> You might figure they also manage a small bed and breakfast at the same location, however we do not necessarily recommend you staying there as it is pretty much in the middle of nowhere and it's not cheap.


## 🚗 How-to get there

<!-- TODO: Mention: You'll definitely need a car. -->
